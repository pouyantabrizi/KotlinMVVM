# KOTLIN with MVVM

Very simple android application based on Kotlin language and mvvm architecture(pattern)
(in progress)


### Major Libraries

* Kotlin
* Android Architecture Components (ViewModel, LiveData, Room)
* Dagger2
* Retrofit
* RxJava
* Glide

### Define

* Kotlin. https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/comparison-to-java.html
* Architecture - MVVM. This was the go to choice as the Android Architecture components best fit in it.
* Dependency Injection - Dagger 2. DI makes it easy to reuse our `RoomDatabase`, api interfaces, preferences and other components.
